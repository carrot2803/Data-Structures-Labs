# How do i run this

To run your code, you can either compile it manually using the following commands:
```sh
g++ *.cpp -o Output.exe
./Output.exe
```

or use the Dev files in Dev.cpp. Other ways to compile also exist; these are just my recommendations.

# Why are there no drawings?

I will add drawings closer to the exams. Due to my other exams, I don't have time to convert my paper drawings to a digital format.

# What are these weird functions and patterns used in some parts?

These functions are not directly related to the problems being solved and are used to generate sample outputs in the main function.

## Will you do past papers again?

Depends on if my time allows for it, as I have exams coming up.
